        "1": "**Encourage equality, diversity and inclusion.** Our differences are our strength. Harassment and discrimination of any kind is not tolerated here.",
        "2": "**Be excellent to each other.** First, be kind. Be helpful. Keep all feedback constructive and framed positively.",
        "3": "**Keep it PG.** Malicious content (illegal, dangerous, phishing, doxing, etc) is never allowed. Sexual content is not allowed, unless the following conditions are adhered to: it’s a print in showcase that’s clearly labelled NSFW, it’s hosted externally (e.g imgur) and the link is wrapped in ‘< >’ to disable the auto-preview/embed. Swearing is allowed but should be used appropriately.",
        "4": "**No guns.** Absolutely no talk of making functional firearms (weapons that use gun powder). Talk/pictures of Airsoft/Nerf/etc prints are ok, so long as they couldn’t be confused for a real gun by an uneducated member of the public.",
        "5": "**Keep discussions to their relevant channels.** Each channel has a description, read them and be sure you’re posting in the right place.",
        "6": "**Don’t spam.** Spam includes: posting similar content across multiple channels, rapid-firing short messages, and advertising other discords (send these links via PM).",
        "7": "**Speak up, we’re here to help.** Ask a mod or admin about any rules you’re unsure about before you post. Speak up if anyone is breaking any rules (including via PMs)."
