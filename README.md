# Discord Bot
This bot is designed for the 3DPrinters discord server and consists of a core bot with a range of plug in 'modules' that can be used to alter the function to fit various needs. It is not currently optimised to run in multiple servers at once. Loading / unloading of modules during runtime allows updates to be made without having to close down the bot so service can be uninturrupted.

**A lot of parameters are hard coded meaning the bot will probably not work on other servers.**
